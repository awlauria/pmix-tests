These are unit tests for PMIx. They are designed to be built
using a C compiler (specified by setting CC in the environment)
and require the following:

* you have set PMIXHOME in the environment to point to the
  prefix location where PMIx was installed

* you have set EVENTHOME in the environment to point to the
  prefix location where libevent was installed

If either PMIx or libevent (or both) were installed in default
locations, then you don't need to provide these envars. The
Makefile will search for the installation in the following
locations (in precedence order):

* /usr
* /usr/local
* /opt
* /opt/local

If it doesn't find an installation in any of those locations,
the compile is likely to fail. Your only option at that point
is to help the Makefile out by setting the appropriate envar
as above.
